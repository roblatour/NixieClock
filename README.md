# NixieClock
Poor man's Nixie clock

Project setup instructions are found at https://hackaday.io/project/167860-poor-mans-esp32-nixie-clock

Nixie tube images derived from vector images available at https://www.vectorstock.com/
I licensed these images so that I could share them as part of this project
If you want your own images for other purposes, you can license them from vector stock as well; images used in this project are very small; if you want larger ones again ... you can license them yourself from vector stock

printable enclosures are the same except to the spacing between the posts for mounting the esp board; check your board before deciding which enclosure to print
